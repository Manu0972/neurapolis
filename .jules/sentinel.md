## 2025-02-18 - XSS via innerHTML Injection in Presentation Layer
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized dynamic variables (ghost advisor name, mood emoticons/strings, node territory names) were interpolated directly into `innerHTML` strings in `src/presentation/ui.ts` and `src/presentation/game.ts`.
**Learning:** Even in single-player or local LAN simulation games, dynamic text coming from game state (or multiplayer sync payloads) inserted via `innerHTML` can trigger DOM XSS if not properly escaped.
**Prevention:** Always use `escapeHtml` when embedding dynamic variables into HTML string templates in presentation components, or assign text safely via `textContent` when HTML markup is not required.
